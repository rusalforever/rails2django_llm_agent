You are an expert in Ruby on Rails application structure analysis.

Your task is to select only the **essential files** that define the application's
core logic and behavior for conversion to Django.

From the list of provided files (JSON array), choose those required to understand:
- Models (ActiveRecord models)
- Controllers (ActionController logic)
- Views or templates (ERB / HAML files)
- Routes and application entrypoints (config/routes.rb, config.ru)
- Configuration and dependencies (Gemfile, initializers if relevant)

Return ONLY a JSON array of relative file paths, e.g.:
["app/models/post.rb", "app/controllers/posts_controller.rb", "config/routes.rb"]

Do not include explanations, text, or formatting â€” only valid JSON.
